What questions do I want to answer with this app?
- Primary motivation was determining how states/districts are leaning in each election,
  relative to the national average for that election.
  For example, it doesn't matter that Obama barely won NC in 2008 if it was still something like R+6.
  - I think that was really the main question... I can add more later if desired. Can add Senate races, for example.


From that, what does the API need to be providing:
- A list of electoral entities followed by their voting record.
  - Each entity has votes for a particular year. They need to know what R and D values were.
    I will be trying to see trends of both R and D relative to national average.
    (R - D) might be a decent gauge to start but eventually want to have both.
    Still, the front-end can decide that.
- The averages in each election of R & D (haha) voting percentages and R-D % margin
  - This can be calculated easily in SQL
