What questions do I want to answer with this app?
- Primary motivation was determining how states/districts are leaning in each election,
  relative to the national average for that election.
  For example, it doesn't matter that Obama barely won NC in 2008 if it was still something like R+6.
  - I think that was really the main question... I can add more later if desired. Can add Senate races, for example.


From that, what does the API need to be providing:
- A list of electoral entities (currently only states) followed by their voting record.
    The API is exposing both the percentages for D/R/3rd party and the total vote share, statewide and nationwide.
    Now it's also showing the difference between the state and the nation - finally getting closer to what we wanted to see!
